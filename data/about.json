  "description": "I'm a full-stack developer passionate about blending AI with web technologies to build meaningful digital experiences. From leading a 17-member team to build my college’s official website, to developing AI-powered solutions like an automated Timetable Generator and a Smart CCTV Alert System, I love turning bold ideas into polished, scalable systems. When I’m not coding, I’m exploring cutting-edge tech, polishing my DSA skills, or mentoring peers in their dev journey.",
